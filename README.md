# group-meet
This is a community connection web app designed to organize quick events surrounding popular activities like chess, community kickball, or even leetcode.

My purpose in choosing to develop this project is to have a fast and streamlined avenue to test my proficiency in AWS and other Cloud Technologies along with BDD (Behavior Driven Development) and Scrum overall. Throughout my development of this project I will be seperating each weeks work into sprints and maintaining best practices when it comes to BDD and Agile Methodologies. Below is an example of a task I made for week two.
