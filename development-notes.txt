The purpose of this document is to track the progress of my development over several weeks and make notes on what I 
have discussed with my mentor as to what to accomplish moving forward.

*Week 1*

What I completed:
- a mock-up built using HTML and templated tailwind CSS
- introductory Jira tasks for week one completion
- scaffolding of the project and initial commits to Github

What I could have done better:
I still struggle with focus when there are so many exciting possible project ideas to consider. Why commit to this project when *this* project
idea is better. I have successfully refocused but I will document below the idea that kept me so torn during my first week development.

- Build out a GPT Action that systematically stages a higher level project descriptions into behavior driven development templates and then use
Jira API to automatically create the hypothetical tasks in Jira. The profitability on this project is very high as SaaS projects target entities
with access to high amounts of capital. It also simplifies something that often took many hours at my Capital One internship. This will be an
exciting project that I will give myself the privledge of working on after I complete this project. Behavior Driven Development is a technique
where tasks are written in a Given, When, Then format to emphasise information in a clear, testable, and business-value oriented way. Integrating it
with scrum allows for a powerful way for interdisciplinary teams to all understand the happenings of a project, from developers to testers to 
business stakeholders.

What I aim to complete next week:
- a basic login page so that I may more quickly transition to firebase integration
- firebase integration to handle user authentication
- bonus tasks:
    - Google Login API Integration
    - Github Login API Integration
